# -Automatic_Vehicle_Plate_Detection_Using_Digital_Image_Processing
A lightweight and efficient Automatic License Plate Recognition system built using Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques and Tesseract OCR. The project detects the number plate from a vehicle image, extracts the region, and performs optical character recognition to obtain the final plate number.
